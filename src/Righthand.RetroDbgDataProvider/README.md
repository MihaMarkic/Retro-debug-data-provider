#Retro Debug Data Provider

This project goal is to provide as much debugging support as possible for retro compilers starting with [KickAssembler](https://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html#frontpage):
- debug file parsing

I will add more services and more support types along the path.

This is a .NET 8+ cross platform library.
